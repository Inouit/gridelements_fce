What does it do?
----------------

gridelements_fce is a `gridelements <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/gridelements>`_ extend which improve backend display of FCE and an easy way to make section in them.
*gridelements* team warn you in their documentation that making FCE this way, is not the cleaniest way to do and they are right. You may encounter some difficulties if you want to make some query on your FCE. You've been warned. But if the gain of such things is more significant to you, this extension is made for you.

Did I mention that's we've made a generator to make a FCE line by line? Nope? We'll talk about that later.
